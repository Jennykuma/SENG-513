            <p>
                The california sunset is an extremely compact succulent that embodies a unique, orange-pink colour
                that resembles a californian sunset. The more sunlight and less water it receives, then the colour
                will become more intense. If the succulent lessens the amount of sunlight and receives more water,
                then it will become more green.

                This type of succulent requires a ton of sunlight to have the best possible appearance. Additionally,
                they require gritty, penetrable soil to allow drainage. During the summer, it is important to water
                the plant, but make sure not to over water it. For the winter, make sure to not give it too much water
                as there is not a lot of sunlight. If the succulent is overwatered, then the roots will eventually rot,
                thus the succulent will have pest infestations (this is bad!). It is also important to fertilize the
                soil once during spring.

                It is easy to regrow Graptopetalums by their seeds or leaves. Any rosette that falls off can easily
                grow and root to become a new succulent.
