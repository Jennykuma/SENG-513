            A group of plants that store water in their leaves.  The leaves tend to be thick and fleshy, but some genus and
            species have thicker leaves than others. Succulents tend to thrive in dry climates and donâ€™t like a lot of
            humidity. As with any other plant, proper watering will ensure the best growth and flowering. While they do
            need water to survive, they can endure extended periods of drought, relying on the stored water and nutrients
            in their leaves. If their roots are sitting in water for too long they will start to rot and die.
