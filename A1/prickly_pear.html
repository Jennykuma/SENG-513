            <h3 class="sub-header">about :</h3>
            <p>
                All Prickly Pear Cactus succulents have very flat, round, plump pads that take on the appearance of
                large leaves. In actuality, these pads are altered branches which help the cactus in a variety of
                many ways. Such as storing water and photosynthesis. The cactus is also used for healing and food.
                Prickly Pears have fruits called 'tuna' which are edible and can be found sold in stores.
                Additionally, the pads of the plant can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable.
                These can also be found in stores, sold as 'nopalito'.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-header">growth & care :</h3>
            <p>
                It is best to grow the cactus in a well-drained and sandy soil. It should be a soil that can dry up,
                instead of being moist all the time. Mix together 1/3 part compost, soil and coarse sand.
                <br>
                Watering is not as important in the fall/winter. Water it once/twice a month at best. In the summer,
                water it once or twice a week as there is more sun. In humid/tropical areas, watering is more frequent.

                Pruning will be necessary in some situations as the pads can eventually come into contact with each
                other, or there are deformed / rotting pads. It will help the growth of the cactus greatly by
                removing those pads.
