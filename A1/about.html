            <h3 class="sub-header">what is a succulent ?</h3>
            <p>Succulents are basically plants that store water in their tissues (leaves, stems, or both).
                There are many types of succulents that come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colours. Some even have
                interesting features that make them stand out from others. Some succulents can be found in deserts
                (cacti) or even in cold mountains, jungles, or seaside cliffs. They can tolerate periods of drought
                for as long as a couple months and most succulents grow best under bright light.

            <p style="padding-left: 1em;"> Succulents that can be grown outdoors in pots during spring and summer,
                but need to be indoors during cold weather such as in winter</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="sub-header">growing succulents :</h3>
            <p> To obtain the best growth and colour for your succulent, they will need very bright light
                (put them beside a window where the sun will shine). In humid areas, they will need protection from
                the midday sun asa it may be too hot for them. Different types of succulents will need at least
                6-8 hours of direct sunlight.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Succulents will also need to be planted in areas that <b>never</b> stay wet. Make sure not to overwater
                them! They can be planted in areas with fast drainage such as dry climates or wall hanging pots. To
                improve the drainage, you can add coarse sand or grit to the soil.
